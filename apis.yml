  The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) is a collaborative effort between
  multiple federal agencies to address wildfires and other emergency incidents
  around the United States. NIFC serves as a centralized command center for
  coordinating resources, personnel, and information to effectively respond to
  and manage wildfires. They work to predict fire behavior, mobilize
  firefighters and equipment, and provide support to fire-affected communities.
  Additionally, NIFC conducts research and provides training to improve
  firefighting tactics and strategies. By bringing together the expertise and
  resources of various agencies, NIFC plays a crucial role in ensuring a
  coordinated and efficient response to wildfires across the country.
